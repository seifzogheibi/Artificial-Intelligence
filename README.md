# Artificial Intelligence – Decision Trees Coursework

This repository contains coursework developed as part of the Artificial Intelligence module at the University of Leeds. The project focuses on implementing, training and analysing decision tree classifiers using real datasets.

## Overview
The coursework involved building an end-to-end decision tree classification pipeline, covering data preprocessing, model training, pruning and evaluation. A key focus was understanding how model complexity, feature selection and pruning parameters affect performance and interpretability.

## Key Components
- Loading and preprocessing tabular datasets
- Filtering missing or invalid values
- Computing descriptive statistics for feature analysis
- Training decision tree classifiers
- Evaluating models using accuracy and recall
- Applying cost-complexity pruning (ccp_alpha)
- Analysing tree depth and model complexity
- Identifying important features influencing predictions

## Techniques and Concepts
- Supervised learning (classification)
- Decision trees
- Stratified train-test splitting
- Model evaluation (accuracy, recall)
- Cost-complexity pruning
- Feature importance analysis
- Bias–variance trade-off

## Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter / script-based execution

## What This Demonstrates
- Practical understanding of core AI and machine learning concepts
- Ability to implement and evaluate classification models
- Experience controlling model complexity and avoiding overfitting
- Structured problem-solving and analytical reasoning
- Clear, modular code design aligned with specification-based tasks

## Notes
This project was completed under assessed coursework constraints and prioritised correctness, clarity and interpretability rather than production deployment.
